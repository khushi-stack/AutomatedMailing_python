# Python_MiniProject
1) Firstly we imported all the essential libraries like pandas , smtplib , MIMEmultipart , MIMEtext
2) Then we have read the csv file , which is kpkp.csv
3) We have find the lenght of the emails in csv file and stored in the variable l
4) Run a for loop and inside that give body , subject , from and to details
5) Then quit the connection

# Challenges faced
1) VS code not reading csv file : We added utf-8 with our file name , and just at bottom right of vsCode we have UTF8 option click on that , the pop up comes and save the file.
2) Password : We wrote our original password , which is very wrong because code can be accessed with anyone . So to avoid data breaching we used google's apppassword , which basically gave us the encyrpted version of password to write in our python script.
